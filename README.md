# Advent of Code 2023

Learning Rust by solving the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Expect slightly messy code, I'm neither a very 
experienced Rust programmer, nor will I spend a lt of time polishing the code to perfection.


## Structure

Each day is in a sub-folder `day_xx` which contains a binary that solved the challenge, plus auxiliary code. 
The input(s) are not checked in to not spoil any fun ;) 

## Log of learnings

The (Rust specific) things I learned each challenge:

- Day 1
  - How to use the Regex crate

- Day 2
  - The aoc_parse create is super nice for parsing inputs

- Day 3
  - How to use a Box to return an Iterator from a function 

- Day 4
  - TBD

- Day 5
  - TBD

- Day 6
  - TBD
