# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Expect messy code, I'm neither a very 
experienced Rust programmer, nor will I spend a lt of time polishing the code much.


## Structure

Each day is in a sub-folder `day_xx` which contains a binary that solved the challenge, plus auxiliary code. 
The input(s) are not checked in to not spoil any fun ;)
